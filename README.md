## Features

- Works on both iOS and Android(currently fallback to RN `Text` on Android)
- Native iOS rendering with smooth selection.
- Nested fragments merge into a single native text view
- Rendering Markdown and HTML (coming soon).
- Supports only the New Architecture

## Requirements

- React Native v0.78.0 or higher (Fabric/Nitro Views)
- Node 18+ (Node 20+ recommended)

## Installation

```bash
yarn add react-native-nitro-text react-native-nitro-modules
```

iOS

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Thatâ€™s it. You can now use the `NitroText` component in your app.

## Usage

```tsx
import { NitroText as Text } from 'react-native-nitro-text'

export function Title() {
  return (
    <Text style={{ fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
      ðŸš€ NitroText Showcase
    </Text>
  )
}
```

## Platform Support

- iOS
- Android - At the moment `NitroText` fallback to RN `Text`.

## Why NitroText?

Custom native text view with minimal JS overhead and native iOS selection. Great for heavy/nested styled text and large lists. It's a drop-in replacement for RN `Text` component.

## Development

- `bun run build` â€” typecheck and build the package
- `bun run codegen` â€” regenerate codegen outputs
- Example app in `example/`
